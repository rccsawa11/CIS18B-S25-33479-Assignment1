This program is the CIS-18B Lesson 1 Assignment. 

This program is a simple banking system. The whole progam is written in the Java file 'Account.java'.
It runs entirely through the console with user selected input. 

The user will be able to: 
Create accounts wit their names with their choice of deposit
Make deposists and withdraws
Check the balance of the accounts
Switch between different accounts 
And Exit the program at any time with a goodbye message

The Account class has all the getters and setters and the bank class handles all of the logic and user input 
There is exceptoin handling built in to prevent crashes and non number inputs

Use of ArrayList is also included to manage multiple accounts. 

For future improvements, 
I would like to add account deletion and checks to prevent from deleting when the balance is > 0 and add a transaction history for each account.

This project really taught me how to build a simple object oriented application and it was my first time managing multiple objects in one runtime.
